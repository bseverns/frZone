# 01 — Calibrate Your Bands

Goal: Make each band trigger **about equally** on a provided loop (or pink noise).

- Choose band edges in `BAND_BOUNDS` to match musical elements (kick/snare/hats/etc.).
- Tune **threshold** so each band triggers when that element is present.
- Add **hysteresis** and **cooldown** to eliminate double‑hits/chatter.
- Deliver: a short (1‑2 min) screen capture + a paragraph explaining your choices.
