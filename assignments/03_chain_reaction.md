# 03 — Chain Reaction (Group Piece)

Goal: Group A’s audio drives Group B’s system (and optionally vice‑versa).

- Decide who owns which bands. Keep arrangements simple.
- Compose a beginning, middle, end. Use **cooldown** creatively for phrasing.
- Document your network/MIDI routing so others can reproduce.
