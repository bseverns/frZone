# 02 — Build a Performer Map

Goal: Route /bandTrigger to **something else** (lights, visuals, sampler).

- If using Python, start from `examples/osc/python_receiver.py` and branch.
- In TouchDesigner, drop an **OSC In CHOP** on port 9000 and visualize bands.
- In a DAW, map incoming MIDI to drum sampler or clip launcher.
- Deliver: a 2‑minute demo + a README describing the mapping logic.
